Lotto:

Scanf fread read buffers (chunks of bytes at once) and then they read out of the buffer the amount of bytes until they reach a char that indicates “stop” (AKA \n)
This means that when we then use read which uses fd, that is NOT buffered. The bytes will read the input that is after the buffer from the prev scanf.
To know how many bytes are needed for the buffer , we used strace -e read to see how many bytes were read in the process of scanf.
Notice the difference between scanf %d (chars) vs the read(0) bytes

Bash tricks. Bypass filter by using “/bin/cat %S%S “fl” “ag”
Evn vars
Use python to read a file with original privlidges
